<p>

To use this applet, enter functions in the bottom left, and press the "Show Formulae" button in the bottom right to render them.

<p>

Use the Algorithm Name and Analysis Mode text boxes to import substitution rules for an algorithm in the database, for example, "binary heap" "expected" would load the expected time complexity of binary heap operations.  You can create your own functions and variables in the Substitution Panel as well.  The subject is rather coplicated, but the Demos at the bottom explain very effectively by example.  To get started, with an example, click "Partial Sort" or "Dijkstra's".

<p>

The applet is very large, and sometimes has trouble loading.  I recommend <a href="http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~ccousi01/algorithms/complexity.jar">downloading the jar</a> if any problems are encountered.
