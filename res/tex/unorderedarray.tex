An unordered array is one of the simplest and least ordered way to represent a set.  The following analysis assumes the data structure is implemented as a continuous array where everything must be shifted when the minimum element is removed.  Additionally, the array is finite and must be dynamically expanded when it is full and \texttt{insert} is called, leading to the amortized analysis of this function.  Slight variations on this technique, such as using a dynamically expanding circular buffer, exist that an improve the complexity of several operations without changing the spirit of the data structure.
