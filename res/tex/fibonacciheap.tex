The Fibonacci Heap is an interesting data structure with slightly better amortized asymptotic complexity than an $k$-ary heap.  The primary motivation behind the Fibonacci Heap is the $O(1)$ amortized reduce key operation: this allows a lower asymptotic complexity to be derived for Dijkstra's Algorithm.  An intuitive explanation of the Fibonacci Heap algorithm can be found \href{http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/teaching/fibonacci-heap.pdf}{here}, and an interactive visualization of a Fibonacci heap can be found \href{http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/FibonacciHeap.html}{here}\footnote{Unfortunately, this visualization is more limited in the scope of its operations than the analysis here, but it suffices to get the key ideas across.}.
