The Brodal Queue is an asymptotically efficient data created by Gerth St√∏lting Brodal in 1996\cite{Brodal}.  For a relatively clear implementation (written in scala), check out \hyperref[this implementation]{https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Heap.scala} from the scalaz library.
