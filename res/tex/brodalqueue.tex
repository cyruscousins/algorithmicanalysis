The Brodal Queue is an asymptotically efficient data created by Gerth St√∏lting Brodal in 1996 that matches the amortized complexity of a Fibonacci Heap in the worst case.  Brodal said of the queue that it is ``[not] applicable in practice,'' but that has not stopped people from implementing them, as in \href{https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Heap.scala}{here}.
