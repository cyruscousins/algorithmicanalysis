The Brodal Queue is an asymptotically efficient data created by Gerth St√∏lting Brodal in 1996.  Brodal himself describes the very complicated queue as ``[not] applicable in practice,'' due to the high constant factors involved.  Nonetheless, people have implemented the Brodal queue.  For a relatively clear implementation (written in scala), check out \url{https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Heap.scala} from the scalaz library.
